## Introduction
Numerous online lending platforms have emerged in recent times, offering loan opportunities to businesses,
similar to banks. However, they are also faced with the risk of user loan default, which is correlated to the
sustainability and healthy development of the platforms.
The importance of calculating and predicting credit risks cannot be overemphasised. Evaluating an
individualâ€™s financial information and historical data is pivotal to predicting whether he/she would default
on a loan or not.


Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information,
and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card
borrowings. The bank or lending company is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant or
not. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
The project will focus on predicting whether an applicant is qualified to receive a loan or not.
